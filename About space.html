                <mark><b>What is universe?</b></mark><br>
                The universe is everything that exists, including all <em>space, matter, energy, time</em><br><br>
                The universe is so vast that it's difficult to imagine. Light from distant objects in the universe can take <em>billions of
                years</em> to reach Earth.<br><br>
                The branch of science that studies the universe is called <b>cosmology.</b> Cosmology combines <b>astronomy</b> and <b>physics</b> to
                understand the universe's <em>origin, development, structure, and size.</em><br><br>
                The Big Bang theory is a widely accepted model that states that space and time emerged together <strong>13.787 billion years
                ago</strong>, and that the universe has been expanding ever since.<br><br>
